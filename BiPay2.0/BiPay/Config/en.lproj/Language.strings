//协议内容
"protocolContent" = "Dear user: \n \n thank you for choosing BiPay service, in the use of BiPay (hereinafter referred to as\" BiPay \"or\" the software \"), please read the \"BiPay service agreement\" and later noted that the agreement, in particular the provisions of this agreement \"liability and limitation of liability\" and other terms will be reflected in the form of a bold, make sure you fully understand the terms of the provisions of this agreement, and independent considering risk. You download the BiPay software and create or import the wallet, which means that you have fully read and accepted all the terms and conditions of this agreement. This agreement takes effect immediately and is binding on both parties. If you are under 18 years of age, or a person with no or limited capacity for civil conduct, please use BiPay under the guidance of your parents or guardians. 1. BiPay: develop a multi-currency wallet management software based on blockchain technology. \n\n (1) users must be natural persons with full capacity for civil conduct; \n\n (2) if you use BiPay for minors under the age of 18, you need to use BiPay under the guidance of your parents or guardians. Where a person without capacity for civil conduct USES BiPay or limits the capacity of a person for civil conduct to conduct transactions beyond the scope of his or her civil rights or capacity, BiPay shall have the right to hold you and your parents or guardian accountable for all consequences arising therefrom. \n\ 3. Creating or importing a wallet: the process by which you confirm the performance of this agreement and create or import a wallet using BiPay. \n\n4. Wallet password: during the process of creating BiPay wallet, the software operation interface prompts you to fill in the password, which is used for payment confirmation. Once lost, you need to reset the new password with the help of login password. \n\n5. Private key: composed of 256-bit random characters, is the core of digital tokens owned and used by users. \n\n6. Public key: generated from the private key through the one-way derivation of cryptography principle, and used to generate the block chain digital wallet address, which is the public collection address. \n\n7. Login password: composed of 18 letters or Numbers generated by random algorithm, convenient for users to backup and keep. \n\n 3, service contents \n\n1. Create or import wallet. For digital tokens supported by BiPay, you can use BiPay to generate new wallets or compatible wallets generated by other wallet tools imported into the relevant blockchain system. \n\n2. You can use the transfer and collection functions of Bipay to manage digital tokens, that is, to use the private key for electronic signature and to modify the ledger of the relevant blockchain. Transfer refers to that the payer USES the recipient's blockchain address to transfer the money, and the actual transfer and collection behaviors all occur in the relevant blockchain system (instead of BiPay). \n\n3. You can use BiPay to see the price of the digital token offered. BiPay is displayed in the market section by capturing the corresponding digital token exchange rate information. \n\ 4. Transaction records. We will copy all or part of your transaction records through the blockchain system. But transaction records are based on blockchain system records. \n\n5. Suspension of service. You are aware of the \"irrevocable\" property of transactions based on the blockchain system. We cannot suspend or revoke transfer transactions or other operations for you, but under certain circumstances, we can suspend or restrict the operation of a user to the BiPay software. Disclaimer \n\ n1.BiPay will take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information as far as possible under the conditions of the current technology level to avoid information leakage, tampering or damage. The system USES wireless mode to transmit data, so the privacy and security of data transmission through wireless network cannot be guaranteed. If you are a user outside the People's Republic of China, you need to fully understand and comply with all relevant laws, regulations and rules regarding your jurisdiction and use of financial services. \n\n2. If you have any questions about the use of personal information during the use of BiPay service, you can contact us by submitting feedback at BiPay. \n\ 3. Any translated version of this policy is provided for the convenience of users only and is not intended to amend the terms of this policy. If there is a conflict between the Chinese version and the non-chinese version of this policy, the Chinese version shall prevail. \n\n matters not covered by this policy, you are required to comply with the notice and relevant rules updated by BiPay from time to time.";
